# odesign

`odesign` is an optimal design of experiments library written in pure rust. It
allows to find optimal designs for (quasi-) linear models considering arbitrary
optimalities.

## Use Cases

- Fast calculation of optimal designs of arbitrary linear models with custom
  design bounds and optimalities.
- Research in area of optimal designs; e.g. I am working on a new optimal design
  feature selection algorithm, a mixture of SFFS, D-, C- and
  Measurements-Costs-Optimality, allowing to perform model feature selection and
  measurements alternating.
